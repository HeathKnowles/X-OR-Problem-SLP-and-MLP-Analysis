# X-OR-Problem-SLP-and-MLP-Analysis
Single Layer Perceptron and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Analysis of Both on the X-OR Problem. Checking Functional Analytics of the problem to both the models.

Just use the Single and Multi Layer perceptron to analyse the X-OR problem to check how the Single layer Perceptron Fails and the Multi-Layer Perceptron succeds.Made a small analysis on that
